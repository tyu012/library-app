# Library

This project is an assignment for The Odin Project. The requirements can be viewed [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library).

## Functionality:
* Adding books
* Removing books
* Listing books
* Marking book entries as read
* Saving and loading books using localStorage

## Learning outcomes:
* I have learned how to use objects to represent data.
* Through the usage of a book object and form object, I have learned how to add shared functions in a prototype.
* Through the usage of localStorage, I have learned the JSON stringify and parse methods, as well as understanding that JSON.parse() returns a Object-type object instead of a Book-type object.
